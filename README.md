TODO:
 - [ ] mj-include PRIO 1) -> add to the renderer a Configuration record
 - inline style support (?), implement fallback as mjml-net
 - check https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml/compare/v4.14.1...v4.15.3 , printing especially
 - validation api:
   - add "parent element" check
   - attribute unit type check
 - improve the renderer, we are still creating too many strings
 - cleanup/rewrite the box model, kinda hacky
